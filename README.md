# Introducing-the-MC14500-1-bit-CPU-and-friends
An investigation of the MC14500 Industrial Control Unit.

Introduced in 1977, the Motorola MC14500 is a small, low cost device, targeted at Industrial Control, the implementation of ladder logic and the manipilation of moderate speed serial communications.

Implemented in CMOS logic, and thus able to tolerate a wide range of voltages, the device was intended to be used within a design based on Motorola's MC4000 series CMOS logic.

For a detailed description of operation and applications - there is a comprehensive Applications Manual, which is the primary source of information on this part.

A clone of the MC14500 has been created in 74HC00 logic:
